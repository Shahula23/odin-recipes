The Odin Project - Recipes Project

This is the first project in the Foundations section of The Odin Project. The task is to build a basic recipe website to practice the HTML I have learned so far. 

In addition to the HTML, I have included very simple CSS to practice what I have learned so far in the "CSS Foundations" module.
